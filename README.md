# VanillaStoryline-Visual-Novel
An addon for VanillaStoryline for WoW 1.12

Do you like immersion? 
Do you like WoW-Voiceover?

Well then I have just the thing for you!

This is a modification of VanillaStoryline that changes the way characters are displayed to give dialogue a more Visual Novel kind of style.


This release is in an alpha state. I have made fitting placements of all base game races, both PC and NPCs as well as the Goblin and High Elf races on Turtle WoW. 

However, there are lots of NPCs and Quest givers in the game that aren't any of these races, and I need to tweak them by hand when I encounter them while playing, so if you encounter any that look weird, please sumbit the name, coordinates and possibly a screenshot of their location here or on the Turtle WoW forum post! 

Check https://www.nexusmods.com/worldofwarcraft/mods/871 for previews, as I will be updating images there. Also Check out the Turtle WoW forum post https://forum.turtle-wow.org/viewtopic.php?p=111625

UPDATE:
After some trail and error and testing with larger characters, I here by declare that it is highly recommended to make the mod fullscreen!
I really wanted it to be useable at any window size, but some characters are simply too tall and/or wide and can't be properly fitted within the frame and I want to prioritize having the character height differences more or less right.

Enjoy!
