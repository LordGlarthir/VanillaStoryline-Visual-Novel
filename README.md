# VanillaStoryline-Visual-Novel
An addon for VanillaStoryline for WoW 1.12

Do you like immersion? 
Do you like WoW-Voiceover?

Well then I have just the thing for you!

This is a modification of VanillaStoryline that changes the way characters are displayed to give dialogue a more Visual Novel kind of style. 
I am trying as best I can to make the in-dialogue height difference between characters be as realistic as possible, but for "larger than tauren" npcs, I have opted for downsizing them and showing their face, rather than the realistic height.
Because of this, it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to maximize the addon ingame.

This release is in an alpha state. I have made fitting placements of all base game races, both PC and NPCs as well as the Goblin and High Elf races on Turtle WoW. 

However, there are lots of NPCs and Quest givers in the game that aren't any of these races, and I need to tweak them by hand when I encounter them while playing, so if you encounter any that look weird, please sumbit the name, coordinates and possibly a screenshot of their location here or on the Turtle WoW forum post! 


Enjoy!
